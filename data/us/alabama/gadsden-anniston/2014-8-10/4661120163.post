        Many people will try and sell you the service of installing Linux on your computer. Here is what you should know about it.<br>
<br>
• It's not Microsoft Window's<br>
<br>
Although this one should fall under the "duh" category, you shouldn't expect Linux to be Windows. Linux has some striking similarities to Windows: the graphical interface, cascading menus, applications represented by icons, configurable desktop themes, and most of the desktop gadgetry you've come to expect from Windows. It looks and behaves like Windows, but it isn't. Its fans say that it's better because of its stability, its multi-user capability and its overwhelmingly cheaper price (free is hard to beat).<br>
<br>
Yet, Linux still falls short of the Windows glory that it attempts to mimic--at least on the surface. Windows enjoys multiple advantages over Linux: thousands of paid developers, a giant marketing machine, third-party vendor support, several more years of existence, and a dedicated individual and corporate user base. It's no small wonder that Windows dominates the market for the world's available computing dollars.<br>
<br>
In many ways Windows vs. Linux is like the old VHS vs. Betamax video format struggle. Betamax was the superior product, but it never caught on in the consumer marketplace. Linux is a more modern version of the Betamax format. Linux isn't Windows. It will never be Windows.<br>
<br>
• Printer Support Is Not There.<br>
<br>
It's true that Linux doesn't have a large number of choices when it comes to peripheral support. And, if you've ever tried to set up printing under Linux, it's likely that you're missing a few locks of your hair. There are hundreds of supported printers in the list but if yours falls outside that list, good luck to you. After spending hours searching forums, you may find that your printer isn't supported at all and neither does it emulate any supported printer.<br>
<br>
Linux creates more printer-shaped doorstops and sculptures than any other contemporary operating system. The solution to this problem is to check your Linux distribution's Hardware Compatibility List for printer and other peripheral compatibility prior to conversion. On the other hand, it's probably time to replace that paper-gobbling dinosaur for something newer anyway.<br>
<br>
• Documents and Files<br>
<br>
This particular problem has more to do with the applications that run on Linux rather than the operating system itself. You will find general document and file compatibility with users of Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop and other popular software programs that run on Windows. General compatibility means that you can open, read and edit most of their attachments and file types. Files that won't work with the OpenOffice.org office suite, the Graphics and Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) or other similar application on Linux likely have some proprietary "hook" or special attribute that can only be interpreted by the original software that created it. Linux users often find themselves asking others to use creative tactics in order to help with compatibility problems. Performing "Save As" operations or exporting to a neutral file format usually solves the problem but requires effort from both parties.<br>
<br>
• It Requires Tech Skills<br>
<br>
Linux requires a higher level of computer knowledge to make things work. That isn't to say that ordinary users can't use Linux, but to perform more advanced functions--such as setting up peripherals that aren't plug-and-play or installing non-packaged software--you'll need those higher level technical skills. Setting up Linux workstations is relatively simple, but Linux server services require a very skilled technical person to enable and configure them. If you're the type that likes to tinker with computers, to learn new things, and to celebrate a victory when you're successful, then Linux is for you.<br>
<br>
Making the switch to Linux requires a dedication to the Linux platform, the Linux concept, and the ability to solve problems under often difficult circumstances. Realize that Linux doesn't support every printer or peripheral on the market. If you're considering a switch to Linux, you probably know that some obstacles exist and that you'll have to make a few compromises along the way.<br>
<br>
If you want stay with the familiar and comfortable pitfalls that you're accustomed to, use Windows. Or, to really dumb down your computing environment, you can pay the extra money for Apple products. You can also choose to suffer a little pain, make a few exceptions, use Linux to power your desktops and servers and experience a new level of computing freedom.<br>
<br>

In closing you may only pay a small amount to have this great operating system installed but how much will you pay in service calls when you need help? Help for doing things you use to be able to do yourself with Windows.
